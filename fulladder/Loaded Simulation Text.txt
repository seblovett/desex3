Simulation of cell was done by emulating realistic conditions. This meant loading the outputs with two inverters each, and driving the inputs each trough one inverter. This produced a magic file "fulladder_ld.mag" which was then simulated using hspice after extraction to spice files. Measure commands were used to determine propagation delays from each input to each output. These measured the time from an input going high to an output going high or low, and the time from an input going low to an output going high or low. Averages were then taken to determine the propagation time between each input changing and the correct output being expected at an output.
