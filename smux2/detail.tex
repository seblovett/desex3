\celldescription{A 2 input scannable multiplexer, intended to be connected to a
raw D-type to create a scannable D-type.}

A single Euler path was used when laying out this cell, before taking into
account inverters. The Euler path (T-nT-D-S) was designed such that the output was all the
way on the right side such that it could connect directly to the D input of the
raw D-type. Once this was done the required internal inverters were added in by
creating a gate matrix design.
