\celldescription{A 3 input scannable multiplexer, intended to be connected to a
raw D-type to create a scannable register.}

A similar approach was taken for the layout of this cell as for the smux2.
Initially inverters were excluded and a single Euler path
(D-Load-nTest-Test-SDI-nLoad-Q) was found that both
kept M and Q as close to the right side as possible (to connect to the raw
D-type) and  kept the Test/Load nearest to their inverted partners for easy wiring.
For the internal inverter placement multiple layouts were trialed to find the
most efficient one, that also allowed all the internal wiring to be done with
metal 1 exclusively(to reduce the number of vias).
