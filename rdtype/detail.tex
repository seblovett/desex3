\celldescription{Raw Dtype}

This gate matrix design was optimised by arranging polysilicon columns to allow as many transistors to fit on a row as possible.
Three rows of PMOS transistors and four rows of NMOS transistors make up cell.
Routing power rails up both sides of the matrix allowed the design to be further compressed.
The D input on the middle left was intentionally not surrounded leaving only metal1 to reroute when it came to dimension matching.
